# Logistic-Regression
K class Logistic Regression Classification based on K binary logistic classifiers
Abstract—The aim of this repo is to demonstrate the use of
K-Binary Logistic Classifiers for K class classification as a valid
and efficient technique compared to the relatively complex and
computationally cumbersome Multiclass Logistic Regression
techniques for K class classification such as the one implemented
by MATLAB as mnrfit() in Statistics and Machine Learning
Toolbox™. 

For testing purposes we used a dataset from UCI [1]data sets repository. The data set is described in detail in the [Report](/report_logistic.pdf)

Detailed formulation of the classification based on K Binary Logistic Classifiers is provided. The developed method can be downloaded as a MATLAB toolbox

The reported toolbox (developed package) performs up to 60 times faster with a slight-trade-off in accuracy.
